# Relational Symbolic Execution for WebAssembly

This is an implementation of rel.sym.exec. in a large-ish fragment of WebAssembly.
It was done as part of my MSc. thesis at KTH.
The model is based upon the concrete model which Asumu Takikawa developed at https://github.com/takikawa/wasm-redex .
Thank you Asumu for making your work available for others to build upon!
